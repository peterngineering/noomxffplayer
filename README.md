Welcome to Noomxffplayer

**I have found (maybe as others also) that ffmpegs 'ffplay' can do the old job the deprecated omxplayer was doing.

So this project was renamed:

'noomxffplayer'

I should have tried this more indepth from the beginning since omxplayer was based on ffmpeg, duh!

I will be testing and ffplay on my old debian bullseye based omxplayer kiosks to get the right configuation and share
that back here. 
*I will not release a dedictated build for this unless absolutely neeed for proof of concept only.*

With the right building of ffmpeg/ffplay one can achieve freedom away from omxplayer and ensure updates will be coming.
