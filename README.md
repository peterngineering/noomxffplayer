**Ohmxplayer**

omxplayer is deprecated, not many (if any) are developing around it since newer technology exists with open source and newer clean supported APIs.

Then why bother creating yet another incarnation of a bitrotted deprecated stack?

Simple:
*Omxplayer still accels at doing one thing great:* 
**Displaying mpeg4 streams live with no gui, in hardware (with very little cpu needed).**

A lot of debating has gone around that other technologies can do the same thing that are actively developed.
	Most often its suggested for one to use one of the following alternatives configured for console use.
  To which I would generally agree with, for most uses.
  
  1. vlc      
  2. mplayer/mpv 
  3. ffplay with SDL

*I may actually move towards building one of those after this, for a direct comparision.

**Stern Warning!** *A lot of developers don't appreciate anyone making it easy for people to use technologies they want dead, no longer develop, that are deemed deprecated,
So don't go asking for help anywhere for this, you been warned! Your own ur own if you try this and even more if you use it.*
